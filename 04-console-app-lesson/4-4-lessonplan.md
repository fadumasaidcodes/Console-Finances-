## 1.Console Finances Challenge (180 mins)

### 1.1 Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (15 min)

Welcome students back to class!

* Open `challenge/starter/index.js` and explain the following:

  * During this week's challenge, you will use your new JavaScript skills to analyze the financial records of a company.
  
  * You will be provided with a dataset in the form of an array. This dataset is composed of arrays that all contain two indexes, the Date and the Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, the records are simple).

  * Accessing data and manipulating/utilizing that data is a huge part of our jobs as developers. Getting comfortable reading through large sets of data is key.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to use JavaScript to read and manipulate data.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã The material is new but will build our knowledge for use with HTML and CSS later.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Reading and manipulating data is a large portion of a front-end developer's job. This project allows use to continue to practice those newly aquired skills.

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Challenge Requirements found in `challenge/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.

### 1.2 Student Do: Challenge (150 mins)

#### Your Task

In this challenge, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the required activity. This activity presents a real-world situation in which your newfound JavaScript skills will come in handy. You are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file.

## Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository.

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 25
  Total: $2561231
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.

**Hints:**

* You will need to do some research on your own for this project!

* Remember, in order to combine strings and variables in the console you will need to use **concatenation**.

* How do you only print to the nearest 100th in JavaScript?

## Grading Requirements

This homework is graded based on the following criteria:

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria.

### Deployment: 32%

* Application deployed at live URL.

* Application loads with no errors.

* Application GitHub URL submitted.

* GitHub repository contains application code.

### Repository Quality: 12%

* Repository has a unique name.

* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

* Repository follows best practices for variable naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

* Repository contains quality readme with description, screenshot, link to deployed application.

## Review

You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository that contains your code. Give the repository a unique name and include a README file that describes the project.

### 1.3 Recap (15 mins)

Take these last few minutes of class to make sure that everyone has submitted their challenge, even if it is not complete. Make sure you encourage students that were not able to finish, by reminding them that these challenges are difficult, and meant to push them.

If time allows, take a few questions from the class about areas in the challenge they had a difficult time with. If needed, use the provided solution to guide them through these questions. Remind students to utilize Office Hours if they need a more thorough explanation.

## 2. Instructor Do: Office Hours (30 minutes)
